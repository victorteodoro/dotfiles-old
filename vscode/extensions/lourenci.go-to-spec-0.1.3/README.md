# Go to Spec

This extension allows you to switch between your code and its test file like Intellij IDEs.

This extension is agnostic to the language that you are coding. I have been using with `.rb` and `.js` code with no problems.

## Features

* You can switch from code to spec file.
* You can switch from test to code.

## Using

Calls `Go to Spec` command (cmd+shift+t or ctrl+shift+t).

#### Go to code
![Go to code](https://github.com/lourenci/go-to-spec/raw/master/docs/go-to-file.gif)

* Your spec may be in the same folder of the code with `spec` or `test` in suffix of the file.
* Your spec may be in a different folder of the code with `spec` in suffix of the file.
