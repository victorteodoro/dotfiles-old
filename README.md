## dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. They are not yet really tidy and clean, but I'm getting there.

### Getting Started

```sh
# Clone it
git clone git@github.com:victorteodoro/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles

# Run the setup to symlink the files
# Remove your dotfiles into another directory first
./setup.sh
```
